# SEO Project 2024

This project is part of my school SEO assignment for 2024. The goal is to demonstrate effective search engine optimization techniques using 100% free tools.

### 🌐 Domain via Namecheap (Free Offer)
I obtained my domain using Namecheap's free offer. It’s a great way to get started with SEO without any upfront costs.

### 📦 Hosting with GitHub Pages
For hosting, I’ve chosen GitHub Pages, a free and efficient tool that allows me to deploy my site without any expense. It’s simple, fast, and fully free.
